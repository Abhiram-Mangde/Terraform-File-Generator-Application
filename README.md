# Terraform-File-Generator-Application
A simple system that accepts user input for resource creation (e.g., a VM), generates a corresponding Terraform configuration file based on predefined templates, and provides the user with a downloadable file. The prototype will simulate the role of Agentic AI by using predefined templates instead of full NLP-based AI.
